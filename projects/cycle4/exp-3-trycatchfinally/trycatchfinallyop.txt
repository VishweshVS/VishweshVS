Welcome to the program, today will seeing how to use try, catch, finally blocks and by understanding their functions.

There is an equation a/(b-c), which requires the initialization of the variables. You must initialize them:

<HINT:If you want the exception to be caught, then try initializing the values of b & c such that their difference is zero.>

a:
12

b:
3

c:
3
Exception caught:Division by zero
I am in final block
